These are sample scripts, hopefully more will be added.

If this project references the EzPlugin Project then it will actually do reasonably
good code completion.

EzPlugin does not require import or package statements for the most part, but they
are there in most of these because it makes eclipse happy, if they are being edited
in a text editor, feel free to ignore them.
