Original code all by Bill.Kress@gmail.com (I wasn't very good at doing the copywright comment thing)

Minecraft plugin designed to make it simple to create plugin scripts written in groovy.

Running this plugin will require a recentish version of Groovy to be accessable.  I did this
by placing the Groovy jar in the same directory as the Minecraft server and Bukkit.  (It also
requires Bukkit, obviously).

To compile the project you will need a copy of Bukkit in this directory (and you may have to
modify the dependencies in EzPluginProject to match the version number.)
